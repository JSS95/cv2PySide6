   Video display pipeline with cv2PySide6

cv2PySide6 is a Python package which converts :class:`PySide6.QVideoFrame` to :class:`numpy.ndarray` and displays it on GUI.
This task is very common in scientific visualizing, especially in the field of image analysis.

:class:`.FrameToArrayConverter` converts the video frame to numpy array.
After any desired processing is done, the resulting array can be passed to :class:`.NDArrayLabel` to be displayed.
:class:`.NDArrayVideoPlayerWidget` and :class:`.NDArrayCameraWidget` are convenience classes with pre-built pipelines.
